1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
I guess I'm a little foggy on this topic. Box 3, because it comes last?

2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
Display: block means that the element will take up the entire width available.
Display: inline will take up the minimum width possible, allowing other elements to line up with it horizontally.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
Align-items adjusts along the cross axis.

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
Fixed: no breakpoints and no percent based layouts
Adaptive: has breakpoints but no percent based layout
Fluid: all percent based but no breakpoints
Responsive: has breakpoints and percent based layout

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
It sets our breakpoint and allows us to calculate the percentages for elements we want to respond to viewport changes.
