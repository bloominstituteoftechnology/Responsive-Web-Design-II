            <h2>Our Start on the Farm</h2>
            <p>The Great Idea! Team consists of a dozen unsettlingly literate sheep. We were all born on this farm and the vision underpinning Great Idea! Company was too. That's right, we are putting the valley back into Silicon Valley. Our open-office plan is a literal pasture. You might be wondering, "Alright, is this the true origin story of Great Idea! Company or an excerpt from the popular Philip K. Dick novel, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'" Our answer to you is, "Wow, that's a really specific observation, but indeed this is the solemn truth."</p>

            <h2>Self-Taught: Sheep Cannot Legally Enroll in Accredited Universities</h2>
            <p>Our staff all have grassroots educational backgrounds, as well as steady grass diets. After being turned away from almost every higher education institution, our unyielding sheeps set out to trailblaze a path of their own. Fortunately, sheep are allowed to use and exploit the internet for profit and personal gain. Several of our top-shelf sheep attempted to enroll in "Lambda School" but it turns out that there is no relation between Lambda and lambs.</p>

            <h2>By Sheep; For Sheep</h2>
            <p>As we first started work on Great Idea! Company, we realized how few tech resources were being allocated to sheep. It became our greatest undertaking to promote accessibility beyond the human species. To that end, we donate a portion of our profits to the charitable organization "Wifi for Every Sheep."</p>
