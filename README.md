# Responsive-Web-Design

It's time to expand our skills into mobile devices.  You will be creating a fully responsive version of the desktop that you have been building all week. You will be working through design mock ups for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices located in the `design-files` folder.

## To Get Started

* Fork / Clone this project into a directory on your machine.
* Open the code with your preferred integrated development environment (IDE).
* Start on the objectives

## Objectives

* [---] Constrain your container class with a `max-width` of 880px
* [---] Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 768px and 400px.  
* [---] Review each [design file](design-files) and build your styles at each breakpoint.
* [---] Convert all fixed widths, left and right margins and paddings throughout the site into percents. You will know this is working if you never see a horizontal scroll bar when you resize your browser.
* [---] Introduce `font-size: 62.5%;` into your `html` selector.
* [---e] Convert all font-size pixels into rem units
* [---] Do your best to make the breakpoints look pixel-close-enough

## Stretch Goals:
* [ ] Build the services page from earlier assignments into a responsive design using your own creativity
* [ ] Once you have completed the project with max-width media queries, start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like.  I recommend making a copy of all your contents in a new folder named "min-width" to keep it separate
