# responsive-web-design

For this challenge, no new code has been introduced but many new concepts are needed to accomplish the task.

*Concepts required to complete the task:*

How to use media queries

Min and max width

Layout changes based on device width

Percent vs fixed layouts


## Task:

Build an adaptive website that has breakpoints at 400px, 768px, and 1100px.  This project is very open ended and meant to challenge what you learned today.  The correct solution will have breakpoints at the directed values but how it looks is up to you.

Remember that an adaptive layout updates at breakpoints only.  Don't worry about percent based fluid layouts.  That's coming up in the next project.
