# Responsive-Web-Design I & II

We will be using the same codebase for Responsive Web Design I and II modules.  You have been provided design mock ups for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices located in the `design-files` folder.

## Project 1: Adaptive Layout

For project 1 you will build an adaptive website that has max-width breakpoints at 400px and 768px based on the designs provided to you in this repository.  You have been provided desktop styles so you can focus on your media queries.

*Concepts required to complete the task:*
* How to use min and max-width
* Media queries using max-width
* Flexbox layout techniques are preferred

Remember that an adaptive layout updates at breakpoints only.  Don't worry about fluid layouts for this challenge.

*Tasks to complete:*
* Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 400px, 768px.
* Review each design file and adjust your styles at each breakpoint. **Hint: Change your container class to width: 100% at the 768px breakpoint.**
* No horizontal scroll bars are acceptable at the exact breakpoint.  At 400px and 768px you should only see a vertical scrollbar.  Everything else is fine to have a horizontal scroll bar as this is not fully responsive.

* Once you have completed these tasks, reach out to your Project Manager for approval before moving into the stretch goal.

* Stretch Goal: Once you have completed the project with max-width media queries, start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like.


## Project 2: Fully Responsive Website

Now that you have introduced media queries into your project, it's time to upgrade your adaptive site to a fully responsive layout!

To accomplish this challenge you will need to incorporate your knowedges of max and min width, media queries, rem units, and percents.

*Tasks to complete:*
* Convert all fixed widths throughout the site into percents
* Convert all left and right margins and paddings into percents
* Convert all font-size pixels into rem units
* Make the breakpoints look pixel perfect using the design files
* Stretch Goal: Copy and paste your project to a new folder and make a 100% fluid layout design by removing breakpoints.  There is no right answer here, I just want you to see what happens when constraints are removed.
